Although I have been studying mathematics for twenty years, I have never really understood mathematical theory. I am not sure if it makes sense for me to study it again now, but I want to try! Here, I want to try some new method about studying linear algebra, advanced mathematics and probability theory. so, how to improve the skill in mathematics? As same as other skill and technology, if you want improv the mathematic skill, at first, you should make a clearly aim, you should think about what's the state you  want get from mathematics? helping your research? or other target? for me, i think my target is to charge my research direction？i have to change my major close to Operation resaerch！like the blog ~\url{https://www.cnblogs.com/xitingxie/p/5684254.html}.
