## Anomaly detection

How detect outlines by machine learning methods?

#### Anomaly Detection in Time Series

*Time series are observations that have been recorded in an orderly fashion and which are correlated in time.*

***Subsequences**: This term refers to consecutive points in time whose joint behavior is unusual, although each observation individually is not necessarily a point outlier. Time Series: Entire time series can also be outliers, but they can only be detected when the input data is a multivariate time series.*
