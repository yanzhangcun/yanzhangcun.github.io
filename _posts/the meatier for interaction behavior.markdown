## Good sentence

The aims of the study is to identify cause effect relationships between driving behavior and well being in a real world setting. This knowledge should contribute to a better understanding of when to trigger interventions.

we  conducted  a causal analysis based on a causal directed acyclic graph(DAG) to examine cause effect relationships from the observational data and to isolate the causal chains between the examined variables. we did so by applying the backdoor criterion to the date-based graphical model. the hereby compiled adjustment set was used in a multiple regression to estimate the causal effect between the variables.

The paper proposes a new traffic conflict measure, the counterfactual based conflict. To overcome the drawback of existing traffic conflict techniques. the CBC is formulated based on the potential outcome model, and thus reflicts the counterfactual statement. 

Compared with conventional mediation analysis, causal mediation analysis has several advantages, e.g., by enabling us to evaluate necessary assumptions to establish a valid causal role of the mediator of interest. Despite these advantages and the availability of various software programs, causal mediation analysis has not been employed frequently in educational research.
